#IRCBot

This is a simple irc bot framework that uses [sorcix](https://github.com/sorcix/irc) and a fork of [nickvanw/ircx](https://travis-ci.org/nickvanw/ircx)

this is currently being used by [slack-irc-bridge](http://github.com/voldyman/slack-irc-bridge) to allow the elementary project to manage the IRC using slack.
